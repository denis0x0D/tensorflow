Implemented:
1.IRBuilder pretty much works, using that API is able to build simple shader for element wise add.
2.IRPrinter works, and outputs the text format of the shader.

TODO:
1. Add all binary ops.
2. Cover code with asserts.
3. Implement correct destruction for the internal objets.
4. Consider to implement InstrList with hands written linked list, instead of using std::vector,
  because we probably need an abilit to reorder instructions inside the basic block.
